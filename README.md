# My journey as a Rust developer ðŸ¦€

Welcome to **Rust Basics**! This repository is my personal space to learn and apply the fundamentals of the Rust programming language using Cargo.

## About

This project is dedicated to exploring Rust concepts, writing example code, and building small projects to deepen my understanding of Rust and prepare for advanced development.

## Goals

- Learn Rust syntax and core concepts
- Practice writing idiomatic Rust code
- Build and manage projects with Cargo
- Prepare for advanced Rust and Web3 development

## Structure

The repo will be organized by topics or projects, each managed as a Cargo package with its own `Cargo.toml`.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed. You can install them from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

To create a new project:

```bash
cargo new project_name
cd project_name
cargo run
```

To build and run existing projects:

cargo build
cargo run
